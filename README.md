# Visualization of my Course Evaluations

This repository includes two scripts for visualizing my course evaluations: The first plots the [time trend of students' quantitative evaluations](https://github.com/czymaraclass/evaluations/blob/main/2_EvalOverTime.R), and the second generates a [word cloud](https://github.com/czymaraclass/evaluations/blob/main/1_wordcloud.R) from qualitative feedback (note: raw data is not uploaded to protect student privacy).
